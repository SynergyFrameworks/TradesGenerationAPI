# TradesAPI

# .Net 8 TradeGenerator Service:

This is the main service responsible for generating and managing the stock trades.
It has the following functionality:

Starts and stops generating trades for a specific connection ID.
Sends the generated trades to the connected clients using SignalR.
Maintains a history of the generated trades.
Calculates various trade statistics, such as total volume, total value, average price, and IV spread.

# TradeHub (SignalR Hub):

This is the SignalR hub that handles the real-time communication between the clients and the server.
It has the following functionality:

Starts generating trades when a client connects.
Stops generating trades when a client disconnects.
Sends the generated trades to the connected clients.

This is a real-time options trading data simulator using SignalR. Here's what it does:

# Main Functionality:

Generates simulated options trade data for 35 major stocks (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, etc.)
Creates random trades with realistic options data including:

Price, quantity, strike price
Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
Implied Volatility (IV)

Broadcasts trades in real-time to connected clients
Maintains a historical trade record

To run the service:  *No certificate requred, Service runs on Http

dotnet run
The service will start on http://localhost:5000 or similar port (check console output)

# What to expect:

The service creates a WebSocket endpoint at /tradehub
When a client connects:

Random trades are generated every 100-1000ms
Each trade is sent to the connected client
Trades are also sent to symbol-specific groups
Trades are logged to console

# To test/connect:

You can use a SignalR client (JavaScript, .NET, etc.)
The endpoint accepts websocket connections with CORS enabled
Clients will receive trades via the "ReceiveTrade" and "ReceiveSymbolTrade" methods

#SignalR MessagePack Integration Issues When Enabling binary ecoding with or without compression
Core Problems Encountered
Binary Format Mismatch

The data arrived as [ExtData, Uint8Array] array
First element was ExtData with type 98 (MessagePack extension type)
Second element was Uint8Array containing binary data
The raw format showed patterns like: f0 87 dc 00 10 d9 24 39
Each attempt to parse resulted in "Incomplete message" errors

Protocol Layer Incompatibilities

# SignalR's binary message format expected a specific structure:

Length prefix (4 bytes)
Message type (4 bytes)
Actual message content

Our attempts to reconstruct this format from the raw data failed
The C# to TypeScript translation of complex types was problematic

SignalR MessagePackHubProtocol Issues

The MessagePackHubProtocol in TypeScript expected different formatting than what was being sent
The parseMessages() method consistently failed with "Invalid input" or "Incomplete message" errors
Binary format headers weren't properly aligned between .NET and TypeScript implementations

Implementation Challenges

# Binary Data Handling
typescriptCopy// Attempts to handle the binary data included:
- Direct Uint8Array usage
- ArrayBuffer conversions
- Binary message reconstruction
- Manual header construction

# Data Extraction Attempts
typescriptCopy// Various approaches tried:
- MessagePack protocol direct parsing
- Manual binary data extraction
- Custom binary message formatting
- TextDecoder for JSON conversion

# Protocol Compatibility

C# server serialized objects differently than TypeScript expected
Extension type (98) handling wasn't clear in the TypeScript implementation
Binary message framing differed between platforms


# Root Cause Analysis
# The fundamental issue appears to be:

Different MessagePack implementations between .NET and TypeScript
SignalR's binary protocol adds complexity that isn't fully compatible across platforms
The TypeScript MessagePack protocol implementation may not fully support all .NET MessagePack features

# Solution
# The best solution was to:

Remove MessagePack protocol entirely
Use standard JSON serialization
Let SignalR handle the serialization/deserialization natively
Focus on proper type mapping and validation after receiving the data

This simplified approach proved more reliable and maintainable while still maintaining good performance characteristics.
